<!-- New implementations

    1.- Restyling to look a bit more like the classic pacman game. Smaller pac-dots, dark background
        brigther ghost colors. Border radius to perform ghost shape. This changes made the game easier 
        for human eyes as the contrast with dark background is higer.
    2.- Fixed bug: The game never finished if you eat any ghost. To solve it, I used an additional variable
        to store eaten-ghost points and added them to the total score at the end of the game
    3.- Added a couple of bricks at ghosts place to make it easier for them to get out. Last ghost
        was never able to get out before this change.
